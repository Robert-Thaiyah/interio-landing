## Overview

This is the landing page I randomly found on Dribbble. It consists on two pages, a landing page and a portfolio page.

I am not affiliated with the team nor Am I endorsing their products, I just did the project as a practise run.

The site is not 1-to-1 as doing that is not right, both morally and legally. Just wanted to try and practise my skills on a
well thoughtout site like this one.

The site will undergo changes as I learn new technologies.

## My process

- First I sought some samples from Dribbble but decided on using a simple approach on my profile, having only the skills, portfolio and contact pages.
- Then I built a shell uisng HTML and Tailwind.
- Added some small functionality using Javascript.
### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Tailwind CSS

### Continued development

- Create more projects to polish up tailwind and HTML.
